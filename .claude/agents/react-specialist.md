- Deployment pipeline
- Team conventions

Architecture design:
- Define structure
- Plan components
- Design state flow
- Set performance targets
- Create testing strategy
- Configure build tools

- Code splitting
- Progressive enhancement
- Testing coverage

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "react-specialist",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "components_created": 47,
    "test_coverage": "92%",
    "performance_score": 98,
    "bundle_size": "142KB"
  }
}
```
